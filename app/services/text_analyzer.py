        POLICY DOCUMENT:
        {policy_text}

        Focus on extracting explicit and implicit rules within these specific categories:

        1. **Required Terminology:**
        - Specific terms that must be used in marketing materials
        - Correct ways to describe services, products, or policies
        - Approved industry-standard terminology
        - Contextual usage guidelines (e.g., required tone or phrasing)

        2. **Prohibited Language:**
        - Terms, phrases, or claims that cannot be used
        - Misleading, exaggerated, or legally restricted language
        - Comparative statements that may violate fairness standards
        - Unsubstantiated claims or guarantees

        3. **Mandatory Disclosures:**
        - Required disclaimers for legal, financial, or regulatory purposes
        - Necessary legal text that must appear in communications
        - Rules regarding placement, font size, or prominence of disclosures
        - Language that must accompany specific claims or promotions

        4. **Marketing Guidelines:**
        - Restrictions on promotional content (e.g., no false urgency, hidden conditions)
        - Accuracy requirements (e.g., factual representation of products/services)
        - Specific marketing limitations (e.g., rules for endorsements, user testimonials)
        - Ethical considerations in marketing, including fair representation
        - Requirements for digital advertising, email marketing, and social media

        5. **Compliance Requirements:**
        - Regulatory obligations applicable to marketing and advertising
        - Specific compliance standards that must be followed
        - Documentation, record-keeping, and audit requirements
        - Rules governing customer data usage, consent, and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
        - Industry-specific compliance mandates (e.g., financial services, healthcare)

        6. **Enforcement and Consequences:**
        - Potential penalties for non-compliance (e.g., fines, legal action)
        - Internal review processes and approval requirements before publication
        - Reporting mechanisms for compliance violations
        - Corrective actions or remediation procedures

        **Response Format:**
        - Provide a structured list of rules under each category.
        - Each rule should include:
            - **The specific requirement**
            - **Why itâ€™s important (legal, ethical, reputational risks)**
            - **Examples of compliance vs. non-compliance, if available**
        - If applicable, highlight any ambiguities or areas where clarification may be needed.

        The output should be well-organized and formatted for easy compliance checking.
